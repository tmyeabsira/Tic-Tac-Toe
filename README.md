The Tic-Tac-Toe game, written in C++, is a compact and efficient implementation of the classic board game. It features a simple command-line interface where players input their moves in a grid format. The game checks for valid moves, updates the game state, and determines the winner or a draw condition. Despite its simplicity, it demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and array manipulations. This small project serves as a great introduction to game development in C++, showcasing how even with a simple text-based interface, one can create engaging and interactive experiences.
